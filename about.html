            Tracy Ma is a New York City-based designer, video editor, filmmaker, photographer, and business owner.
            After receiving a B.S. in Integrated Digital Media from New York University in 2021, Ma went from a
            video-editing intern to a full-time video editor, and later, director of content for INSIDER Inc,
            specializing in food-related videos. Wanting to move in the direction of video production and writing,
            Ma later moved to Los Angeles and worked for two years as a creative video producer for Buzzfeed. A few
            years later, spurred by a desire to travel, Ma became a travel videographer for the award-winning creative
            agency, Beautiful Destinations, a job which enabled her to travel the world, making videos and creative
            content that captured the beauty, people, and experiences of other cultures.
